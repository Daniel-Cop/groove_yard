# Groove Yard

## Objective

The purpose of the site is to allow users to manage their vinyl album collection and help them find other albums sold by other 'nearby' users.

## Execution

The site is equipped with a pre-set list of albums, users can then add them to their inventory, specifying whether they intend to simply add it to their collection, announce that they want to sell it or that they are looking for it.

A user will be able to specify to which radius to extend their search so as to be notified when another user within that radius puts the searched album up for sale.

## Unfinished

Missing info about album (track list, desc ecc) and User (createdAt)
